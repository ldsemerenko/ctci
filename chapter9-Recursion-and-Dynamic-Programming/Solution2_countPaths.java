 * A robot sitting on the upper left corner of an X by Y grid. The robot can only move in
 * two directions: right and down. How many possible paths are there for the robot to go
 * from (0,0) to (X,Y)?
 * FOLLOW UP:
 * Certain spots are "off limits", such that robo cannot step on them. Design
 * an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to buttom right.
